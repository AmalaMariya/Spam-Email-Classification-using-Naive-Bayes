# Spam-Email-Classification-using-Naive-Bayes
This project aims to classify text messages as either spam or ham (non-spam) using machine learning algorithms. It leverages a dataset of labeled messages and applies various techniques for text preprocessing, feature extraction, and model training to create an effective spam detection model.

# Project Overview
The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can automatically classify messages into two categories: spam or ham (non-spam). The project uses a variety of techniques such as data cleaning, text vectorization, model evaluation, and optimization to achieve high classification accuracy.

# Technologies Used
Python: Programming language for implementing the solution

pandas: For data manipulation and analysis

scikit-learn: For machine learning models and evaluation

NLTK/Spacy: For natural language processing (NLP) tasks like tokenization and stopword removal

matplotlib & seaborn: For data visualization
